#Project 2:
	In this project we were tasked with making a toy that runs off the
	msp430, this toy was required to use the lights of msp430 launchpad and
	use the sound/ buttons of the msp430 boosterkit. It had to be able to
	change the lights and sound. All Buttons had to be funcional. Lights
	needed to be dimmed and had to have code in assembly.

#Creating Project 2:
	  -Go to go into sub-directory "timerLib" first
	  -use "make" inside the sub-directory
	  -Go to return from subdirectory "timerLib" into "toy"
	  -use "make" in sub directory "toy"
	  -plug in msp430 launchpad connected to msp430 boosterkit into
	  computer/laptop
	  -use "make load"
